Understanding the problem here is pretty straightforward; with *N* and *M*, *N*-*M* indicates a surplus of chicken if positive, a deficit if negative, and so one can tailor the output message depending on these situations. A slight difficulty is the cases of a difference of *1*, since this affects the message to change "pieces" to "piece", which can be an oversight.
