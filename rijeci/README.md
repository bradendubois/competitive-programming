**Problem**: [rijeci](https://open.kattis.com/problems/rijeci)

**Difficulty**: 1.5

## Solution

One starts the tally of *a* to 1, and *b* to zero. Looping *K* times, one stores *a* in a temporary variable, sets *a* to *b* to reflect the transformation of *a* to *b*s, and  adds the original number of *a*s that were shown to *b*. The example/description is not very clear relaying this.
