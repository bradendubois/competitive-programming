# The Last Problem

**Problem**: [thelastproblem](https://open.kattis.com/problems/thelastproblem)

**Difficulty**: 1.6

## Solution

For this, just read *S*, and output "Thank you, *S*, and farewell!". This may be easier/harder depending on language used for string-building but shouldn't be hard.

**Note**: My C++ solution seems to only pass 4 cases, but obviously shouldn't be having much trouble, so I've included a Python 3 solution which passes.
