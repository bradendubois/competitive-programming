**Problem**: [fiftyshades](https://open.kattis.com/problems/fiftyshades)

**Difficulty**: 1.4

## Solution

For this, read in each of the *N* lines, and convert them to lowercase as they're read in. Check the string to see if it contains "pink" or "rose", and if so, increment a tally. At the end, if the tally is non-zero, output it, otherwise "I must watch Star Wars with my daughter".
