## Solution

For this problem, one can first find the time, *t*, but isolating it from the first equation, since one knows all the other parts of this equations, and then using *t* (when one is at the hole) in the second equation to know where one will be at that time, and check that this number is 1 away from both *h1* and *h2*.
