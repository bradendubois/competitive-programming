Since both "ah"s end with 1 single ``h``, the amount of "a"s is simply 1 less than the size of the string, but that is the same for both strings listed, so if the first message is the first line is shorter than the second line, the "aaah" is not long enough, so output "no", otherwise "go".

This is definitely a question with the challenge/lesson being to actually find the *relevant* information, considering the huge amount of info in the page despite the size of the solution.
