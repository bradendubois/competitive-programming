The approach to this one is straightforward, but implementation may be difficult depending on your langauge of choice. Any language can reasonably compare to check the "P=NP" case, but for splitting the string at the "+" and converting to an actual int can be moderately difficult; it'd be blissfully easy if done in Python, thanks to split() and int().
