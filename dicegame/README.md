# Dice Game

**Problem**: [dicegame](https://open.kattis.com/problems/dicegame)

**Difficulty**: 1.5

## Solution

A quick approach (short of simulating all the different combinations and comparing) is to find the "average" of each die, and find an "average" roll for each person and compare. To get the average of a person, one can sum the average value of each die, with is (a + b) / 2.
