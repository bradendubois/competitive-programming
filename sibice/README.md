# Sibice

**Problem**: [sibice](https://open.kattis.com/problems/sibice)

**Difficulty**: 1.3

## Solution

The problem describes dimensions *W* and *H*, which are actually *width* and *length*, which can be a bit confusing. Since some basic trig shows that the hypotenuse of the box will be bigger than either
dimension, one calculates that, and if a match is <= that, it fits.
