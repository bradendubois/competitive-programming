# Pea Soup and Pancakes

**Problem**: [peasoup](https://open.kattis.com/problems/peasoup)

**Difficulty**: 2.4

## Solution

For every case, read the restaurant name and store it, and read every of the *k* items into a menu (perhaps a map). After reading all the items, if you have seen both "pea soup" and "pancakes", output the name and terminate, otherwise, after seeing every restaurant, output "Anywhere is fine I guess".
