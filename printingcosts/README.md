# Printing COsts

**Problem**: [printingcosts](https://open.kattis.com/problems/printingcosts)

**Difficulty**: 2.1

## Solution

For this, the biggest hurdle is moving this giant table of information into a usable format; maybe copy it to a text file and use some CTRL-F / Find + Replace to turn the table into a usable map/dictionary of your choice. Then simply read each line, and iterate through each character, looking up the cost for each character from your map.
