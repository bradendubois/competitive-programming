# Solving For Carrots

**Problem**: [carrots](https://open.kattis.com/problems/carrots)

**Difficulty**: 1.3

## Solution

The solution to this problem is trivial, but the presentation of this problem is interesting, because
it's a great exercise in learning how to actually identify the problem itself, reading between the lines to find the important parts. It's easy to get lost in the 2 blocks of text and descriptions
of the data and miss that the solution is already given to you: output *P*, the number of carrots handed out, which is the second number on the first line of sample data; all other data is totally irrelevant.
